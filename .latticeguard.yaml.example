# LatticeGuard Configuration
# Place this file in your repository root as .latticeguard.yaml

# Environment Configuration
# Tag your repository to adjust risk scoring based on environment
environment: production  # development | staging | production

# Data Classification (for HNDL scoring)
data:
  longevity_years: 10  # How long does data need protection?
  sensitivity: confidential  # public | internal | confidential | secret | pii | financial | health

# Scan Thresholds
thresholds:
  # Fail CI/CD pipeline if findings exceed these thresholds
  fail_on: high  # low | medium | high | critical
  max_critical: 0
  max_high: 5
  max_medium: 20

# Suppression Rules
# Suppress findings that are false positives or accepted risks
suppressions:
  # Suppress by file path patterns (glob)
  paths:
    - "**/test/**"
    - "**/tests/**"
    - "**/__tests__/**"
    - "**/fixtures/**"
    - "**/mocks/**"
    - "**/.git/**"
    - "**/node_modules/**"
    - "**/vendor/**"
  
  # Suppress by algorithm (accepted risk)
  algorithms:
    # Example: Accept RSA-4096 for now (approved by security team)
    # - algorithm: "RSA-4096"
    #   reason: "Approved exception until 2027 migration"
    #   expires: "2027-12-31"
    #   ticket: "SEC-1234"
  
  # Suppress by finding ID
  findings:
    # - id: "path/to/file.py:123:RSA-2048"
    #   reason: "Test fixture, not production code"
    #   approved_by: "security-team@company.com"

# Algorithm Allowlist
# Only these algorithms are considered "safe" (quantum-safe)
